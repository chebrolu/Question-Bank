For editable bounding boxes : 

	1) Using images : 
		Image editing tools : 	
			a) https://www194.lunapic.com/editor/; 
			b) https://www.tutorialspoint.com/add_shape_photo_online.htm 
		Convert Image to pdf : 
			a) Check out camscanner
			b) Online tools
		Convert pdf to image :
			Online tools available : a) https://pdftoimage.com/

		(conversion from image to pdf and back is possible)

		Does the bounding box coordinates remain the same after inter conversions? 

	2) Using pdf as is : 
		Very difficult to get editable pdf online (adobe tool to edit pdf's offline)	

		Found this tool online : 
		a) https://github.com/jsoma/kull

		b) https://skim-app.sourceforge.io/

For Question Classification : 
(Seems like an overkill : assuming only question/answers in the pdf, i.e. the format we can do much better.)
(Hard Coding this part seems like a much more feasible option : Allow for things like heirarchy of questions.)
