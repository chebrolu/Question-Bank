Bugs :

1) Looks at questions page wise.

2) Consider conventions like {(a), (b), (c)} ; { Problem 1, Pr...}, etc?

3) A lot of empty space is also recognized as a question or answer (see annotated-final06-with-answers pg 6)

4) check 'annotated-final-solution-pax.pdf' : last page : dont know why a bounding box over there.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additional Features : 

1) Incorporate space (empty spaces) features to distinguish, (keep this as an option)

2) Incorporate and use info like format : Q/A, Qs or Qs n As

3) Incoporate conventions where we have a main question and some sub questions. 

4) Add option to display annotated pdf's with editable boxes on a web browser. (Main Problem)

5) Incorporating font characteristics as delimiters

Solutions  :

1) Instead of boxes keep markers.
With that end of page heights and last page end of page

2)
